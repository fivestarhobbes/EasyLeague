List of Requirements
====================

- Must be a python application with a GUI
- The GUI will be implemented using the PyQt library
- The user can create and sign people up for league events
- It will run on my laptop and then I will create a distribution package later
- It will use a csv roster file from your computer
- csv roster will be converted to a sign up sheet
- the user can select those who participate in the league
- the application will create round robin groups after everyone has been signed up
- at first groups will be automatic only, but later I will add manual functionality such as
- inserting or removing a player from a group, changing the size of each group
- add a new player who is not on the roster
